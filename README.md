# RF-with-Autonomous-Irrigation-Vehicle
In this project, an autonomous agricultural mechanism, connected to remote and closely controlled sensors, was designed using RF communication.
A similar project was designed in Konya Science Center, Science in the Garden, and participation in the Aselsan Future of Water competition was ensured.
